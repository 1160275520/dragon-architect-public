Error Code Ranges for various parts of the backend
Each language has its own error code namespace, and here's the common errors:

0000 - 0999: reserved
1000 - 1999: syntax errors
2000 - 2999: serialization errors
3000 - 3999: type errors
4000 - 4999: runtime errors
5000 - 8999: reserved (probably overflow once a language runs out of codes)
9000 - 9999: miscelleny specific to a language
10000+     : reserved

Error code '1' (for each range) should usually be "internal error".
So for example, 1001 means the parser crashed and we don't know why,
and 4001 means the runtime crashed and we don't know why.
